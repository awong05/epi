Jingle wants to generate more page views on its news site. A product manager has
the idea to add to each article a sidebar of clickable snippets from articles
that are likely to be of interest to someone reading the current article.

Design a system that automatically generates a sidebar of related articles.

Hint: This problem can be solved with various degrees of algorithmic
sophistication: none at all, simple frequency analysis, or machine learning.

"""

"""
The key technical challenge in this problem is to come up with the list of
articles—the code for adding these to a sidebar is trivial.

One suggestion might be to add articles that have proved to be popular recently.
Another is to have links to recent news articles. A human reader at Jingle could
tag articles which he believes to be significant. He could also add tags such as
finance, sports, and politics, to the articles. These tags could also come from
the HTML meta-tags or the page title.

We could also provide randomly selected articles to a random subset of readers
and see how popular these articles prove to be. The popular articles could then
be shown more frequently.

On a more sophisticated level, Jingle could use automatic textual analysis,
where a similarity is defined between pairs of articles—this similarity is a
real number and measures how many words are common to the two. Several issues
come up, such as the fact that frequently occurring words such as "for" and
"the" should be ignored and that having rare words such as "arbitrage" and
"diesel" in common is more significant than having say, "sale" and
"international".

Textual analysis has problems, such as the fact that two words may have the same
spelling but completely different meanings (anti-virus means different things in
the context of articles on acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and
computer security). One way to augment textual analysis is to use collaborative
filtering—using information gleaned from many users. For example, by examining
cookies and timestamps in the web server's log files, we can tell what articles
individual users have read. If we see many users have read both A and B in a
single session, we might want to recommend B to anyone reading A. For
collaborative filtering to work, we need to have many users.
