"""
Given two singly linked lists there may be list nodes that are common to both.
(This may not be a bugâ€”it may be desirable from the perspective of reducing
memory footprint, as in the flyweight pattern, or maintaining a canonical form.)
For example, the lists in Figure 7.6 on the following page overlap at Node I.

Write a program that takes two cycle-free singly linked lists, and determines if
there exists a node that is common to both lists.

Hint: Solve the simple cases first.

NOTES:
- The lists overlap if and only if both have the same tail node: once the lists
converge at a node, they cannot diverge at a later node. Therefore, checking for
overlap amounts to finding the tail nodes for each list.
