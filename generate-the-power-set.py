"""
The power set of a set S is the set of all subsets of S, including both the
empty set 0 and S itself. The power set of {0,1,2} is graphically illustrated in
Figure 15.5.

Write a function that takes as input a set and returns its power set.

Hint: There are 2**n subsets for a given set S of size n. There are 2**k k-bit
words.

NOTES:
- Each subset set must appear in U or in V, so the final result is just U union
V.
- For a given ordering of the elements of S, there exists a one-to-one
correspondence between the 2**n bit arrays of length n and the set of all
subsets of Sâ€”the 1s in the n-length bit array v indicate the elements of S in
the subset corresponding to v.
- In particular, when n is less than or equal to the width of an integer on the
architecture (or language) we are working on, we can enumerate bit arrays by
enumerating integers in [0, 2**n - 1] and examining the indices of bits set in
these integers.
