"""
It is natural to apply graph models and algorithms to spatial problems. Consider
a black and white digitized image of a mazeâ€”white pixels represent open areas
and black spaces are walls. There are two special white pixels: one is
designated the entrance and the other is the exit. The goal in this problem is
to find a way of getting from the entrance to the exit, as illustrated in Figure
18.5 on the next page.

Given a 2D array of black and white entries representing a maze with designated
entrance and exit points, find a path from the entrance to the exit, if one
exists.

Hint: Model the maze as a graph.

NOTES:
- Since the problem did not call for a shortest path, it is better to use DFS.
