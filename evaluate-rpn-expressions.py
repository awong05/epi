"""
A string is said to be an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish notation (RPN)
if:

(1.) It is a single digit or a sequence of digits, prefixed with an option â€”,
e.g., "6","123","-42".
(2.) It is of the form "A,B,o" where A and B are RPN expressions and o is one of
+, -, x, /.

For example, the following strings satisfy these rules: "1729", "3,4,+,2,x,1,+",
"1,1,+,-2,x", "-641,6,/,28,/".

An RPN expression can be evaluated uniquely to an integer, which is determined
recursively. The base case corresponds to Rule (1.), which is an integer
expressed in base-10 positional system. Rule (2.) corresponds to the recursive
case, and the RPNs are evaluated in the natural way, e.g., if A evaluates to 2
and B evaluates to 3, then "A,B,x" evaluates to 6.

Write a program that takes an arithmetic expression in RPN and returns the
number that the expression evaluates to.

Hint: Process subexpressions, keeping values in a stack. How should operators be
handled?
