Jingle, a search engine startup, has been very successful at providing a high-
quality Internet search service. A large number of customers have approached
Jingle and asked it to display paid advertisements for their products and
services alongside search results.

Design an advertising system for Jingle.

Hint: Consider the stakeholders separately.

"""

"""
Reasonable goals for such a system include

- providing users with the most relevant ads,
- providing advertisers the best possible return on their investment, and
- minimizing the cost and maximizing the revenue to Jingle.

Two key components for such a system are:

- The front-facing component, which advertisers use to create advertisements,
organize campaigns, limit when and where ads are shown, set budgets, and create
performance reports.
- The ad-serving system, which selects which ads to show on the searches.

The front-facing system can be a fairly conventional web application, i.e., a
set of web pages, middleware that responds to user requests, and a database. Key
features include:

- User authentication—a way for users to create accounts and authenticate
themselves. Alternatively, use an existing single sign-on login service, e.g.,
Facebook or Google.
- User input—a set of form elements to let advertisers specify ads, advertising
budget, and search keywords to bid on.
- Performance reports—a way to generate reports on how the advertiser's money is
being spent.
- Customer service—even the best of automated systems require occasional human
interaction, e.g., ways to override limits on keywords. This requires an
interface for advertisers to contact customer service representatives, and an
interface for those representatives to interact with the system.

The whole front-end system can be built using, for example, HyperText Markup
Language (HTML) and JavaScript. A commonly used approach is to use a LAMP stack
on the server-side: Linux as the OS, Apache as the HTTP server, MySQL as the
database software, and PHP for the application logic.

The ad-serving system is less conventional. The ad-serving system would build a
specialized data structure, such as a decision tree, from the ads database. It
chooses ads from the database of ads based on their "relevance" to the search.
In addition to keywords, the ad-serving systems can use knowledge of the user's
search history, how much the advertiser is willing to pay, the time of day, user
locale, and type of browser. Many strategies can be envisioned here for
estimating relevance, such as, using information retrieval or machine learning
techniques that learn from past user interactions.

The ads could be added to the search results by embedding JavaScript in the
results page. This JavaScript pulls in the ads from the ad-serving system
directly. This helps isolate the latency of serving search results from the
latency of serving ad results.

There are many more issues in such a system: making sure there are no
inappropriate images using an image recognition API; using a link verification
to check if keywords really corresponds to a real site; serving up images from a
content-delivery network; and having a fallback advertisement to show if an
advertisement cannot be found.
