"""
In Problem 12.11 on Page 176 and its solution we introduced the Collatz
conjecture and heuristics for checking it. In this problem, you are to build a
parallel checker for the Collatz conjecture. Specifically, assume your program
will run on a multicore machine, and threads in your program will be distributed
across the cores. Your program should check the Collatz conjecture for every
integer in [1, U] where U is an input to your program.

Design a multi-threaded program for checking the Collatz conjecture. Make full
use of the cores available to you. To keep your program from overloading the
system, you should not have more than n threads running at a time.

Hint: Use multithreading for performanceâ€”take care to minimize threading
overhead.

NOTES:
- The heuristics for checking the Collatz conjecture take longer on some
integers than others, and in the strategy above there is the potential of a
situation arising where one thread takes much longer to complete than the
others, which leads to most of the cores being idle.
- A good compromise is to have threads handle smaller intervals, which are still
large enough to offset the thread overhead.
- We can maintain a work-queue consisting of unprocessed intervals, and
assigning these to returning threads.
